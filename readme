# Audio Recorder and Transcription

This project is a desktop application for recording, playing, and transcribing audio files. It uses PySide6 for the GUI and integrates a speech recognition service using the `transformers` library for transcription.

## Features

- Record audio and save as WAV files.
- Load and play multiple audio files sequentially.
- Transcribe audio files using a pre-trained model and display transcriptions.
- Cache transcriptions to avoid duplicate processing.
- Delete selected audio files and their transcriptions using the `DEL` key.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PySide6
- pyaudio
- ffmpeg (for audio playback)
- torch
- transformers
- pydub

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audiorecorder.git
   cd audiorecorder
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash

3. Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed on your system. You can download it from [FFmpeg's official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python AudioRecorder.py
   ```

2. Use the interface to:
   - Record new audio files.
